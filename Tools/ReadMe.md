## [Git](#Git)
[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is [easy to learn](https://git-scm.com/doc) and has a [tiny footprint with lightning fast performance](https://git-scm.com/about/small-and-fast).

* [Python3 Tutorial:](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_course.php) This online Python course was created and is maintained by Bernd Klein, an experienced Python trainer, giving training classes all over the world. It is an interesting introduction into Python for beginners and intermediate learners with lots of examples and exercises! 

### R
Online Book: [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) <br>

### Project Euler
If you want to solve interesting problems to practice Python or R, then we recommend to solve the problems of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)!

### Anaconda
[Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/): With over 6 million users, the open source Anaconda Distribution is the fastest and easiest way to do Python and R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. It's the industry standard for developing, testing, and training on a single machine.

## [Python Libraries for Data Science](#Python-Libraries-for-Data-Science)
Python continues to take leading positions in solving data science tasks and challenges. [Kdnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/top-20-python-libraries-data-science-2018.html) introduced 20 libraries of Python for data science. Here are five of the most important of libraries: 

### NumPy
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.<br>

* [Python for Data Analysis](https://github.com/ResearchComputing/Meetup-Fall-2013) <br>

### Pandas
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.<br>

* [10 Minutes to Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) <br>

### Matplotlib
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

## [Jupyter and IPython](#Jupyter-and-IPython)
The [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. Also, [IPython](https://ipython.org) provides a rich architecture for interactive computing with in multiple programming languages.
