On the other side, applications are highly recommended for this project. Students should decide on a topic for the project based on their interests as well as discussion with their mentor, who is one of the teaching assistants up to their choice. Mentors could provide advice and assistance during the topic selection and main progress. The following steps are expected: 

    - Selecting a Mentor and Deciding on a Topic
    - Writing a Brief Proposal (at least two paragraphs) of the Project
    - Proposal Approval by the Mentor
